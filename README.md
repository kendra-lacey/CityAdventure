>## :wavy_dash: ABOUT THE GAME
> ### I'm an avid fan of Illana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson - this choose-your-own-adventure style game is inspired by their show Broad City on Comedy Central.
>>Abbi and Illana are two broke bestfriends living in NYC. Abbi is a struggling artist with no health Insurance. She has a massive tooth-ache and needs her wisdom teeth removed. Using good judgment and widsom the player has to make decisons to help Abbi. 
>>#### These are the players options
> - Go to Central Park and people watch while you think about what do to   -> then go back and make a decision.
> - See Illana's partner who is a DENTIST, he can do the prodecure. 
> - Go see if Illana's Veterinarian friend will to the procedure...**risky**
>> After the prodecure you lose Abbi .. she is somewhere in NYC and you have to find her.
