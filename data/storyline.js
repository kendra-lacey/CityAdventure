  //1. increase the index comment by +1 and each next +1 to create room for a new index 0 - to use to store the initial page
  //2. Determine how to inject html into the page based on html that is stored in each index in this file. One option is raw html, another is to store some objects like: structure: [p, div, div] which would then be iterated over to create a div inside a div inside a p. Raw html might be easier
  //3. Create the object for index 0, the initial page
  //4. create the object for the game over page that incudes  additional message
  //5. do something like a message.foreach  where an index object only has one message, it will put the first one in a specific div, and the second message in a different div
  //6. use css to target specific elements and apply styles to move them to where you want them
  //7. add song: introSong to new index 0
